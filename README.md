# Learning Scala

This repo contains some code from some of the resources I am using to learn Scala. The code relates to the following two Scala resources:

1. **progfun**: [Functional Programming Principles in Scala](https://www.coursera.org/course/progfun) which is a Coursera Course by Martin Odersky
2. **scalafp**: [Functional Programming in Scala](https://www.manning.com/books/functional-programming-in-scala) which is a book written by Paul Chiusano and Runar Bjarnason
